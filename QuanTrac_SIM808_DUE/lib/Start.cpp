    advancedFunctions.h - A collection of utilities for Arduino DUE to
    use the advanced functions of the integrated peripherals of
    the Atmel SAM3X8E microcontroller.

    For more infos, please read the README.txt file.

    This sketch tests the WDT blinking the integrated LED for a while
    then resetting the MCU.
